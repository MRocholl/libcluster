/*! \brief Namespace that contains implementations of Bayesian mixture model
 *         based algorithms for clustering.
 *
 *  This namespace provides various Bayesian mixture models that can be used
 *  for clustering data. The algorithms that have been implemented are:
 *
 *    - Variational Dirichlet Process (VDP) for Gaussian observations [1].
 *    - The Bayesian Gaussian Mixture model [4] ch 11.
 *    - Groups of Mixtures Clustering (GMC) model for Gaussian observations [3].
 *    - Symmetric Groups of Mixtures Clustering (S-GMC) model for Gaussian
 *      observations [3].
 *
 *  All of these algorithms infer the number of clusters present in the data.
 *  Also, the sufficient statistics of the clusters are returned, which can be
 *  subsequently used to initialise these models for incremental clustering.

 *         cluster.
 *  \param SS a mutable SuffStat object to store the sufficient statistics of

 *  \param diagcov use diagonal covariance? Default false, use Gaussian-Wishart
